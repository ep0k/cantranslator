==============================
Flashing a Pre-compiled Binary
==============================

Updates to the CAN translator firmware may be distributed as
pre-compiled binaries, e.g. if they are distributed by an OEM who does
not wish to make the CAN signals public. If that's the case for your
vehicle, you will have a ``.hex`` file and can use the
`upload\_hex.sh <https://github.com/openxc/cantranslator/blob/master/upload_hex.sh>`_
script to update your device.

Prerequisites
=============

In order to flash a CAN translator, you need:

* AVR programmer
* FTDI Driver
* Mini-USB cable

FTDI Driver
-----------

If you are using Windows or OS X, you need to install the FTDI
driver. If you didn't need to install MPIDE, you can download the driver
separately from `FTDI <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm>`_.

AVR Programmer
--------------

In order to program the CAN translator, you need an AVR programmer tool. There
are a number of options that will work.

*With MPIDE*

If you have `MPIDE`_ installed, that already includes a version of avrdude. You
need to set the ``MPIDE_DIR`` environment variable in your terminal to point to
the folder where you installed MPIDE. Once set, you should be able to use
`upload\_hex.sh <https://github.com/openxc/cantranslator/blob/master/upload_hex.sh>`_.

*Without MPIDE*

If you do not already have `MPIDE`_ installed (and that's fine, you don't really
need it), you can install a programmer seprately:

- Linux - Look for ``avrdude`` in your distribution's package manager.
- OS X - Install ``avrdude`` with `Homebrew`_.
- Windows
   - If you prefer a GUI, install `WinAVR <http://winavr.sourceforge.net/>`_
   - If you prefer command line, install `Cygwin <http://cygwin.com>`_ and
     `MPIDE`_, and follow the :doc:`installation` documentation to configure the MPIDE
     environment variables.

USB Cable
---------

You need to have the **mini-USB** port on the chipKIT connected to your computer
to upload a new firmware. This is different than the micro-USB port that you use
to read vehicle data - see the `device connections
<http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/index.html#connections>`_ section
of the `OpenXC website`_ to make sure you have the correct cable attached.

Flashing
========

Command Line
------------

When using the command line in Cygwin in Windows, you will need to figure out
which COM port the device shows up as - by default we will assume ``com4`` but
it may be different on your computer.

Once you have ``avrdude`` installed, run the ``upload_hex.sh`` script with the
``.hex`` file you downloaded (Windows users see below, this script will *not*
work with the standard Windows command line or Powershell):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sh ./upload_hex.sh <the firmware file you downloaded>.hex


To specify use ``com3`` for example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sh ./upload_hex.sh <the firmware file you downloaded>.hex com3

In Windows, this command will only work in Cygwin, not the standard
cmd.exe or Powershell. If you have the ``sh.exe`` program installed by
some other means (e.g. you have Git installed in Windows) then it will
actually work in Powershell.

If you get errors about ``$'\r': command not found`` then your Git
configuration added ``CRLF`` line endings and so you must run the script
like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ set -o igncr && export SHELLOPTS && sh ./upload_hex.sh <firmware you downloaded>.hex

WinAVR GUI
----------

The GUI should be straightforward, but additional documentation here would be a
wonderful contribution!
