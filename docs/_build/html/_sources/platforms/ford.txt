Ford Prototype Vehicle Interface
================================

To build for the Ford prototype, compile with the flag ``PLATFORM=FORDBOARD``.

Flashing a Pre-compiled Firmware
--------------------------------

Pre-compiled binaries (built with the ``BOOTLOADER`` flag enabled, see all
`compiler flags <compiling>`_) are compatible with the `OpenLPC USB bootloader
<https://github.com/openxc/openlpc-USB_Bootloader>`_  - follow the instructions
for `Flashing User Code
<https://github.com/openxc/openlpc-USB_Bootloader#flashing-user-code>`_ to
update the vehicle interface.

Bootloader
----------

The `OpenLPC USB bootloader <https://github.com/openxc/openlpc-USB_Bootloader>`_
is tested and working, and enables the LPC17xx to appear as a USB drive. See the
documentation in that repository for instructions on how to flash the bootloader
(a JTAG programmer is required).

Compiling
---------

USB Bootloader
""""""""""""""

If you are running a :doc:`supported bootloader </installation/bootloaders>`, you don't need
any special programming hardware. Compile the firmware to run under the
bootloader:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ make clean
   $ PLATFORM=BLUEBOARD BOOTLOADER=1 make -j4

The compiled firmware will be located at
``build/lpc17xx/cantranslator-lpc17xx.bin``. See the `bootloaders </installation/bootloaders>`_
page for instructions on how to load the firmware.

Bare Metal
""""""""""

Once the :doc:`dependencies </installation/installation>` are installed, attach a
JTAG adapter to your computer and the CAN translator, then compile and flash:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ make clean
    $ PLATFORM=BLUEBOARD make -j4
    $ PLATFORM=BLUEBOARD make flash

The config files in this repository assume your JTAG adapter is the
Olimex ARM-USB-OCD unit. If you have a different unit, modify the
``src/lpc17xx/lpc17xx.mk`` Makefile to load your programmer's OpenOCD
configuration.

UART
----

On the LPC17xx, ``UART1`` is used for OpenXC output at the 230000 baud rate.
Like on the chipKIT, hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled, so CTS must be
pulled low by the receiving device before data will be sent.

- Pin 2.0 - ``UART1 TX``, connect this to the RX line of the receiver.
- Pin 2.1 - ``UART1 RX``, connect this to the TX line of the receiver.
- Pin 2.2 - ``UART1 CTS``, connect this to the RTS line of the receiver.
- Pin 2.7 - ``UART1 RTS``, connect this to the CTS line of the receiver.

Debug Logging
-------------

Logging will be on UART0, which is exposed on the bottom of the board at J3, a
5-pin ISP connector.

LED Lights
----------

The Ford prototype has 2 RGB LEDs.

**LED A**

- CAN activity detected - Blue
- No CAN activity on either bus - Off

**LED B**

- USB connected, Bluetooth not connected - Green
- Bluetooth connected, USB in either state - Blue
- Neither USB or Bluetooth connected - Off
