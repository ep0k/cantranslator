Bootloaders
===========

For those who don't have special microcontroller programming hardware, we strive
to make the vehicle interface firmware compatible with USB bootloaders. This
allows reflashing the firmware by copying a file over to a simulated USB drive,
or by using the popular avrdude tool.

For bootloader details, see the :doc:`supported boards </platforms/platforms>`.
